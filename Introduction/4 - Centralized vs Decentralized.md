# Centralized vs Decentralized

Centralized and decentralized refer to the way that systems or networks are organized and managed.

## Centralized

A centralized system is one where a single entity or organization has control over the system or network. In a centralized system, all data and decision-making are controlled by a central authority or administrator. Examples of centralized systems include traditional banking systems, government agencies, and large corporations. Centralized systems are often efficient and can be easily managed, but they are also vulnerable to security breaches and single points of failure.

## Decentralized

A decentralized system, on the other hand, is one where multiple entities or nodes work together to maintain the system or network. In a decentralized system, there is no central authority that controls all the data or decision-making. Instead, each node has a copy of the data and can make decisions autonomously. Decentralized systems are often more secure and resilient than centralized systems because there is no single point of failure. Examples of decentralized systems include blockchain networks, peer-to-peer networks, and distributed ledgers.
